GameSharing is a C++ bridge to the Java Google Play Games Services SDK and Apples Game Center for cocos2d-X.
You can use this features at the moment:
* Submit scores to Leaderboards
* Open the Leaderboards UI
* Unlock Achievements
* Open the Achievements UI
* Request scores from leaderboards

Requirements
===========

You project must use cocos2d-x 3.2 or higher and you must already have Google Play Services set up for your project.
If you don't know how to do that, you can take a look at a this tutorial I posted on my blog:

http://adriandawid.wordpress.com/2014/08/18/tutorial-how-to-use-google-play-services-with-cocos2d-x-for-android/

On iOS you only need to import the GameKit Library into your project in order to use GameSharing.

How to use GameSharing
=====================

Android:

To use Game Sharing you only have to add the class body  and the imports from AppActvity to your AppActvity.java
class, after that copy the other .java files into your project and replace all your.app.id keywords with your app ID.
Once you did that, set MainActivity to the main activity in your AndroidMainfest.xml file and add AppActvity and NoGPGAppActvity
to the list of Activitys. Then copy the C++/GameSharing.cpp and C++/GameSharing.h file into your project and you are ready to use GameSharing.
For more information please take a look at the wiki.

iOS:

To use GameSharing on iOS, copy the C++ folder into your Classes folder
and add all files inside of the Objetive-C++ folder to your iOS Project.

Then you must change the AppController.mm file like this:

```
#include "GameSharing.h"

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    window.rootViewController = rootViewController;

    GameSharing::initGameSharing((__bridge void *)rootViewController);

}

```

On iOS you must create a ios_ids.plist file in your Resources folder, to store your ids. 
Create two keys in it:"Achievements" and "Leaderboards" set their type to array and then 
add all your ids to the right category, then use there indexes in the array in your c++ code:

```
// Unlocks the first achievement in your list
GameSharing::UnlockAchivement(0);

// Unlocks the fifth achievement in your list
GameSharing::UnlockAchivement(4);
```


Is my project still compatible with other operating systems if I use GameSharing
===============================================================================

Yes it is. The GameSharing class only compiles the Google Play Games relevant parts, if you compile for android and only compiles GameCenter relevant parts for ios.
On other operating system all methods just have no effect at all, but won't produce any compiler errors.

How to extend GameSharing?
==========================

Android:

If you want to add a feature to GameSharing and you know how to develop with the JNI(Java Natvie Interface), you can do that. You just have to add a new static function to the AppActvity and write all GPGS code into it. Then add a new function to the GameSharing C++ class and add this code snipped to it:

```
#if CC_TARGET_PLATFORM == CC_PLATFORM_ANDROID
    if(IsGPGAvailable()){
    JniMethodInfo t;
    if (JniHelper::getStaticMethodInfo(t
                                       , "org/cocos2dx/cpp.AppActivity"
                                       , "yourStaticMethodName"
                                       , "yourMethodSignature"))
    {
        t.env->CallStaticVoidMethod(t.classID, t.methodID);
        // Release
        t.env->DeleteLocalRef(t.classID);
    }
    }
    else{
        MessageBox("Google Play Games Services are not actvie.", "Error");
    }
#else
    CCLOG("No GPGS available on this platform.");
#endif
```


iOS:

To add a iOS feature to GamSharing you need to add a static function to the iOS-Only part of GameSharing.h.
Then implement this function in GameCenterHelper.mm, bear in mind that you need to surround a call to your feature with this code:

```
#if CC_TARGET_PLATFORM == CC_PLATFORM_IOS
    //Your code
#endif
```
